# MWAA Environment Variable Plugin

## Overview

The `MwaaEnvVarPlugin` is a custom Apache Airflow plugin designed for Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). 
This plugin automatically converts MWAA configuration options in the `env` section prefix (e.g., `env.foo_bar`) into 
user-friendly environment variables (e.g., `FOO_BAR`), as opposed to the default `AIRFLOW__ENV__FOO_BAR` provided 
by vanilla MWAA.

## Features

- Automatically detects environment variables set by MWAA through configuration variables (`env` section).
- Converts these variables to user-friendly names without the `AIRFLOW__ENV` prefix and double underscores.
- Sets the new environment variables in the system.
- The new variables are available in all processes (Scheduler, Worker) and override env. variables that might be set in `startup.sh` script.

## Installation

1. Simply add `mwaa-env-var-plugin` into your MWAA requirements.txt:

```
mwaa-env-var-plugin==0.0.5
```

2. By default, in Apache Airflow v2, plugins are configured to be "lazily" loaded using the `core.lazy_load_plugins : True` setting. 
Make sure you add `core.lazy_load_plugins : False` as an Apache Airflow configuration option to load plugins 
at the start of each Airflow process to override the default setting.
